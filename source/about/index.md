## Introduction to Myself

My English name is Garen Wang, and my Chinese name is 王樾. I come from Chaozhou City, Guangdong Province, majoring in Computer Science in South University of Technology.

As a freshman in CS, I am on my way of learning lots of intereting stuff relevant to computer. In spite of limited knowledge, I am trying to learn more and more.

You may ask why I write my own blogs in English. Lots of reasons:

1. My CS study in school is mainly in English.

2. I hope to improve my skills in academical English in CS.

3. I don't need to install sogoupinyin to write my blogs.

## Flags

What I am trying to learn now:

- Computer Science: A Programmer's Perspective(still reading)

- Exploitation(for my SRP)

- Pwn(for CTF)

- Deep Learning(but unfortunately no GPU)

- Series of school lessons(for my poor grades)


## about My Blog

I love sharing my learning process in the form of blogs. Therefore, I deploy this website as my own blog. Since it's a fresh start, just do for it!
