# Introduction to Myself

My English name is Garen Wang, and my Chinese name is 王樾. I come from Chaozhou City, Guangdong Province, majoring in Computer Science in South University of Technology.

As a freshman majoring in CS, I am on my way of learning lots of intereting stuff relevant to computer science. In spite of limited knowledge, I am trying to learn more.

You may ask why I write my own about page in English. Lots of reasons are as follows:

1. My CS learning courses in university are almost in English.

2. I hope to improve my skills in academical English in CS.

3. I don't need to install sogoupinyin to write my blogs in Linux(

# Flags

What I am trying to learn now:

- Computer Science: A Programmer's Perspective(still reading)

- Exploitation(for my SRP)

- Pwn(for CTF)

- Series of school lessons(for my poor grades)

# about My Blog

I love sharing my learning process in the form of blogs. Therefore, I deploy this website as my own blog. Since it's a fresh start, just do for it!
